Verify that some method calls are imported statically. At the moment, as per BCP bank rules, this
looks for:
<ul>
    <li>Assertions methods (like <i>Assertions.assertTrue</i> )</li>
    <li>Mockito general methods (like <i>Mockito.when()</i> )</li>
    <li>Mockito matching methods (like <i>Mockito.isA()</i> )</li>
    <li>Mockito's <i>any()</i> method which is not allowed</li>
</ul>
